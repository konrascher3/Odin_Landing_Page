# Odin_Landing_Page
Complete static landing page based on CSS and HTML

In this project, a complete landing page is constructed based on two images representing the final product (goal state):

![Layout](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png)
![Styling](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/colors_and_stuff.png)

Aim is to put CSS and HTML into a practical context, with a main focus on the CSS flex feature.
